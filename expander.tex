In order to introduce expander graph, the following definitions are of great importance.

\subsubsection{Cheeger's Constant}
Suppose we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset $S\subseteq V$. We wish to define the following
two sets:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \partial S=\{\{u,v\}|u\in S, v\not\in S\}
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \delta S=\{v\not\in S|v\sim u, u\in S\}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{Cheeger Ratio} for a vertex set $S$ is
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        h(S)={|\partial S|\over\min{\text{vol}(S),\text{vol}(\bar{S})}}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where, $\bar{S}=V-S$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    For any graph $G=(V,E)$, the \emph{Cheeger Constant} of $G$ is given by
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        h_G=\min_{S}h(S)
    \end{eqnarray*}
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Cheeger's Inequality}
\begin{theorem}
    For any graph $G$,
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        2h_G\ge \lambda_1\ge {h_G^2\over 2}
    \end{eqnarray*}
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Expander Graph}
A family $\mathcal{G}=\{G_1, G_2,\dots\}$ of $d$-regular graphs is an \emph{edge
expander family} if there is a constant $c>0$ such that $h(G)\ge c$ for each $G\in
\mathcal{G}$. Typically, we want $d$ to be constant, though it is sometimes also
interesting to consider $d=\log{|G|}$ or even $d=|G|^{O(1)}$.

Recall that when considering random walk on a graph, we are specially interested in
the convergence issue of the walk. Expander graphs are actually a good family of
graphs, in the sense that random walk on a expander graph converges due to the
Cheeger's inequality that $h(G)\ge c$ also gives a lower bound of $\lambda_1$,
meaning that random walks converges ``quickly'' on expander graphs.
