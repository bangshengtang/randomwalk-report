\subsubsection{Transition Matrix}
For a graph $G=(V,E)$ we define the \emph{transition probability matrix} $P(u,v)$ by
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(u,v)=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
1\over d_u & \textrm{if u $\sim$ v}\\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray*}
where $d_u$ denotes the degree of a vertex $u$ and $u\sim v$ notation for
$\{u,v\}\in E$.

We represent a distribution on $G$ by a row vector $f$ whose $i$th entry gives the
``amount'' residing at the $i$th vertex $v_i$. A typical initial distribution might
be $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}=(1,1,\dots,1)$, or the row vector $e^*_i$ with all
entries zero except for a one in the $i$th entry. One should note that normalization
is needed when necessary.

If $f$ is the initial distribution, then $fP$ is the distribution after one step,
and $fP^t$ is the distribution after $t$ steps. In a sense, we are considering all
possible random walks simultaneously; for instance, if $f=e^*_i$, the $j$th entry of
$fP^t$ is the likelihood that if we start a walk at vertex $v_i$ and continue for
$t$ random steps that we will find ourselves at vertex $v_j$.

\subsubsection{Stable Distributions}
A distribution $\pi$ is said to be \emph{stable} if the following condition is
satisfied,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pi = \pi \cdot P
\end{eqnarray*}

For a regular graph, it is easy to check that, the uniform distribution
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}$ is a stable distribution.

Generally, if $G=(V,E)$ is an undirected graph and $S\subseteq V$ is arbitrary, then
define the \emph{Volume} of $S$ by
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{vol} S&=&\sum_{v\in S}d_v\\
&=&\sum_{v\in S}\text{vol} v
\end{eqnarray*}
vol$G$ is defined to be vol$V$.

For an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, one may check that the following distribution
$\pi$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pi&=&\left(d_u\over\text{vol}G\right)\\
&=&\left({d_1\over \text{vol}G}, \dots, {d_n\over\text{vol}G}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
is stable.

Similarly, if $G$ is directed, then let $d^+_u$ and $d^-_u$ denote the outdegree and
indegree of the vertex $u$, respectively. Here we do not define the volume of an
arbitrary subset of $V$; we define only
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{vol}G=\sum_{u\in V}d^+_u=\sum_{v\in V}d^-_v
\end{eqnarray*}
But we are not so lucky when considering stable distribution. Define $\pi^+$ and
$\pi^-$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pi^+=\left({d^+_u\over\text{vol}G}\right)\\
\pi^-=\left({d^-_u\over\text{vol}G}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
Then $\pi^+P=\pi^-$, so that there is no hope of obtaining a stable distribution as
we have done above for undirected graphs. In fact, the equation $fP=f$ has no closed
form solution for $f$ in general.
